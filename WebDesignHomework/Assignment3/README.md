# My Web Design Journey

## Reflecting on the Course So Far

This course has been a great opportunity to refresh my knowledge and expand my skills. I’m already familiar with Visual Studio Code, but I’m excited to dive deeper and refine my workflow.  

**One of the highlights** has been working with GitHub and Markdown, as version control is an essential skill for web development.  

*However, I’m looking forward to learning even more*, especially when it comes to optimizing my projects and improving efficiency.  

### Topics I’m Excited About

- Advanced CSS techniques  
- Responsive web design  
- JavaScript best practices  

### A Resource That Has Helped Me
